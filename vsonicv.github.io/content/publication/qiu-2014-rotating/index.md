abstract: Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are popular approaches for
  solving multi-objective problems (MOPs). One representative method is Non-dominated
  Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), which has achieved great success in the
  field by introducing non-dominated sorting into survival selection. However, as
  a common issue for dominance-based algorithms, the performance of NSGA-II will decline
  in solving problems with 3 or more objectives. This paper aims to circumvent this
  issue by incorporating the concept of decomposition into NSGA-II. A grouping-based
  hybrid multi-objective optimization framework is proposed for tackling 3-objective
  problems. Original MOP is decomposed into several scalar subproblems, and each group
  of population is assigned with two scalar subproblems as new objectives. In order
  to better cover the whole objective space, new objective spaces are formulated via
  rotating the original objective space. Simulation results show that the performance
  of the proposed algorithm is competitive when dealing with 3-objective problems.
