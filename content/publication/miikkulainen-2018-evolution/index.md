abstract: Deep learning (DL) has transformed much of AI, and demonstrated how machine
  learning can make a difference in the real world. Its core technology is gradient
  descent, which has been used in neural networks since the 1980s. However, massive
  expansion of available training data and compute gave it a new instantiation that
  significantly increased its power.
