abstract: Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are efficient tools for
  solving multi-objective problems (MOPs). Current existing algorithms such as Multi-Objective
  Evolutionary Algorithms based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) and Non-dominated Genetic
  Algorithm II (NSGA-II) have achieved great success in the field by introducing important
  concept such as decomposition and non-dominated sorting. It would be interesting
  to employ these crucial ideas of the two algorithms in a hybrid manner. This paper
  proposes a new framework combining the key features from MOEA/D and NSGA-II. The
  new framework is a grouping approach aiming to further improve the performance of
  the current existing algorithms in terms of overall diversity maintenance. In the
  new framework, original MOP is decomposed into several scalar subproblems and every
  group is assigned with two scalar subproblems as their new objectives in the searching
  process. Non-dominated sorting is conducted within each group respectively at every
  generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of the
  new framework is competitive when dealing with 2-objective problems.
