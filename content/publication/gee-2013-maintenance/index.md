abstract: Recently, decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D)
  has received increasing attentions due to its simplicity and decent optimization
  performance. In the presence of the deceptive optimum, the weight vector approach
  used in MOEA/D may not be able to prevent the population traps into local optimum.
  In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, namely Diversity Preservation Multi-objective
  Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (DivPre-MOEA/D), which uses novel
  diversity maintenance scheme to enhance the performance of MOEA/D. The proposed
  algorithm relaxes the dependency of the weight vector approach on approximated ideal
  vector to maintain diversity of the population. The proposed algorithm is evaluated
  on CEC-09 test suite and compared the optimization performance with MOEA/D. The
  experiment results show that DivPre-MOEA/D can provide better solutions spread along
  the Pareto front.
