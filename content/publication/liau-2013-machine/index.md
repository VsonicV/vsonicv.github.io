abstract: We address the problem of expensive multi-objective optimization using a
  machine learning assisted model of evolutionary computation. Specifically, we formulate
  a meta-objective function tailored to the framework of MOEA/D, which can be solved
  by means of supervised regression learning using the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  algorithm. The learned model constitutes the knowledge which can be then utilized
  to guide the evolution process within MOEA/D so as to reach better regions in the
  search space more quickly. Simulation results on a variety of benchmark problems
  show that the machine-learning enhanced MOEA/D is able to obtain better estimation
  of Pareto fronts when the allowed computational budget, measured in terms of number
  of objective function evaluation, is scarce.
