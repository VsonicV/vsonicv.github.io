## About Me

Hi, I'm Xin Qiu (仇昕), an AI researcher at [Cognizant AI Labs](https://evolution.ml/). I obtained my Ph.D degree from NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore in 2016 and B.Eng degree from the School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University in 2012. In the scientific world, I'm still a curious kid that loves challenging puzzles. My current research involves:
- developing systematic solutions to quantify the trustworthiness of responses returned by large Language models
- utilizing the power of evolution to resolve architecture/graph search problems
